            <p> In a galaxy not so far away a young boy was dreaming of a future where anything was possible. That boy was me and I was enchanted by the possibilities of creating anything your mind could dream of. Over time the technology came about where anyone with a dream could share that dream with the rest of the world. The internet was born and millions of people without a voice suddenly could be heard. </p>
            
            <p> My name is Brian and I am currently on a journey to a career that will let my voice be heard and allow me to share my thoughts and creative nature with the whole world. By learning Full-Stack Flex Programming technologies at UCSD extension I will learn how to comminicate and create functional and visually interesting web applications for myself and others utilizing multiple computer programming languages and browser based technologies. I welcome you to follow along with me on my journey to see just how far I can go!</p>
